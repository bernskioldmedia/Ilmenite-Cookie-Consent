# 🍪 Ilmenite Cookie Consent
A simple, developer-friendly WordPress plugin that informs users about cookie usage on the site, and lets them both opt in and select their preferences.

There are many WordPress plugins and services out there that do fancy things with cookie consents. We didn't find one we really liked that was both really lightweight and developer friendly. So we created our own.

This plugin isn't meant for the masses who want tons of configurable options in the admin (although it will work and look fine out of the box). Many use this plugin with the default styling because it is light-weight and good-looking. While you can modify texts and choose between three positions in the admin, any more advanced styling requires CSS.

For the developer who wants the functionality and being able to conveniently override the styles and features without bloat—here's a plugin for you. You have filters and actions available to you at every step of the process. From locking down the editing of texts, to changing every option.

## Configuration
The plugin works out of the box with minimal settings. However here are a few things you will probably want to be aware about.

### Set the policy link
You can set the URL to the cookie policy page in the customizer under the "Cookie Banner" section, or use the filter `ilcc_policy_url` to return your own link.

By default we will get the privacy policy page from `Settings > Privacy`.

### Changing/disabling the styling
Out of the box, the plugin includes a lightweight stylesheet with three placement options (overlay, top and takeover). If you don't want to use our default style, you can easily prevent us from including the styles and style it yourself.

Just define the following filter somewhere in your code, such as the theme functions.php file:

    apply_filters( 'ilcc_load_stylesheet', '__return_false' );

Additionally, for quick theming to your theme's custom colors, we support a series of CSS variables set on `body.has-ilcc-banner` like so:

    body.has-ilcc-banner {
        --ilcc-background-color: #ffffff;
		--ilcc-text-color: #1e1e1e;
		--ilcc-link-color: #1e1e1e;
		--ilcc-link-color-hover: #555555;
		--ilcc-close-button: black;
		--ilcc-close-button-hover: #444444;
		--ilcc-close-button-text: white;
		--ilcc-close-button-hover-text: white;
		--ilcc-settings-background-color: #f9f9f9;
		--ilcc-settings-border: #eeeeee;
		--ilcc-toggle-background-color: #e6e6e6;
		--ilcc-toggle-handle-background-color: #b3b3b3;
		--ilcc-radius: 4px;
    }

If you would like to add your own style in addition to the three offered, you can override the style setting with the `ilcc_style` filter. This would let you style outside the three core positions.

### Changing the texts
You can change all texts from the Customizer under the "Cookie Banner" section. Alternatively, you can use our extensive set of filters to return values before rendering. See the list of filters below.

Just set their value somewhere in your code, such as in the functions.php file of your theme:

    function ilcc_modify_consent_text( $text ) {
        $text = __( 'This is my custom text about how we use cookies.', 'YOURTEXTDOMAIN' );
        return $text;
    }

    add_filter( 'ilcc_consent_text', 'ilcc_modify_consent_text' );

    function ilcc_modify_accept_text( $text ) {
        $text = __( 'I Accept', 'YOURTEXTDOMAIN' );
        return $text;
    }

    add_filter( 'ilcc_accept_text', 'ilcc_modify_accept_text' );

## Translations
Included in the package are complete translations for the following languages:

- Lithuanian (Thanks @batiufa)
- Swedish

A complete *.pot* file is available in the *translations/* directory. If you use and translate this little plugin, please send us the translation so it can be included!

**Even better** is if you use Translate.WordPress.org for your translations. That way, they will be automatically distributed with the WordPress updater.

However, in some locales, the work with the Translate site is not up to speed. We will continue to support bundled translations because of this.
