**Version 3.0.0**
Major update with potentially breaking changes.

We are now finally respecting not to set any tracking cookies unless the user has actually accepted all cookies. We keep a running list of trackers that we disable automatically. From analytics to marketing. You can modify the list of trackers via filters in the code or the settings screen.

As a developer, you can disable the settings screens via filters.

To support this, the plugin has been extended quite a bit. There are numerous new strings, filters and options.

We have also added a new style, "take over", if you'd prefer to force the user to make a choice before allowing them into your website. The "overlay" style has now been made the default one for new installs.

- Added the `ilcc_preferences_cookie_name` filter to replace the now removed `ilcc_cookie_name` filter.
- Added the `ilcc_categories_cookie_name` filter.
- Added the `ilcc_remember_duration` filter.
- Added the `ilcc_tracker_settings_enabled` filter.
- Removed the `ilcc_has_user_consented` filter.
- Removed the `ilcc_cookie_active_value` filter.
- Replaced `ilcc_edit_text_capability`, `ilcc_edit_title_capability`, `ilcc_edit_button_capability` and `ilcc_edit_policy_url_capability` with a simpler `ilcc_edit_texts_capability` that takes the setting as an argument.

**Version 2.0.5**

When no policy URL is set in the customer, the default integrity policy URL from the WordPress settings will be loaded.

For those translating via WPML and Polylang, we have added a configuration file that makes the strings you add in the customizer translatable.

**Version 2.0.4**

Fixed a bug where the consent duration wasn't set properly, resulting in us asking the user to consent way more often. The plugin will now (correctly) remember the consent for 30 days, unless the user clears their cookies.

**Version 2.0.3**

Fixed compatibility issues with jQuery 3.
Instead of `$.load(function()` the plugin is now initializing on `.on("load", function()`.
Thanks Viktor.

**Version 2.0.2**

Fixed a small issue where our build script wasn't processing fallbacks for the new CSS variables correctly.
This could lead to the default style not loading properly in older browsers (such as IE 11). This update fixes
this behavior.

As a result, the variables are now defined on :root {}.

**Version 2.0.1**

Svn is svn. Contains nothing new apart from fixing the release archive.
If you managed to update to 2.0.0 in the few minute window before this was
addressed, 2.0.1 takes care of things for you. If not, enjoy the 2.0.0 update.

**Version 2.0.0**

In this major release we've made many code improvements as well as improvements to class names
and the JavaScript that powers most of the features. You will also have better and more
access to filters and actions for customization. Also, new customizer settings and a new core style
gives you quicker access to control the appearance of the banner.

- Improvement: Switched to setting the policy URL in the customizer instead of under Settings > Reading.
- Improvement: Added customizer settings for all texts as well.
- Improvement: Added a second core style "Overlay", offering the option of showing the banner overlaid at the bottom instead of at the top.
- Improvement: Better class names for the consent box.
- Improvement: Re-structured the JavaScript code.
- Improvement: Ensure we get languages from all possible storage folders in WordPress.
- Improvement: Added filter to disable stylesheet loading.
- Improvement: Never process any of the the JS or CSS logic if the user has already consented.
- Improvement: Added filter when we check if user has consented.
- Improvement: Added filter for cookie name.
- Improvement: Added filter for cookie acceptance value.
- Improvement: Modified consent text filter to include the policy URL as a variable.
- Improvement: Added filter for when getting the policy URL.
- Improvement: Switched from an `<a>` tag for the acceptance button, to a more proper `button`.
- Improvement: Added filters for controlling who may edit the settings in the customizer.
- Bug: Fixed a bug where the consent block could add to the DOM multiple times.
